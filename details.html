                <p class="captions">City Palace, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">City Palace has stood at the heart of the Old City of Jaipur for nearly three centuries, shortly after 
                    Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II decided to relocate his court from the city of Amber. Protected by huge 
                    guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's modern-day royal family, and 
                    is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine.<br>

                    City Palace is more than a sand-colored regal abode—it's a sprawling complex of buildings built around 
                    a series of landscaped garden courtyards overlooking Jaipur and Lake Palace. The entire property is 
                    a stunning display of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture.<br>
                    
                    The current occupants reside in the most eye-catching building, the Chandra Mahal, an elegant 
                    structure with curved eaves and domed rooftops. Each of its seven stories features an entirely 
                    different style. The ground floor is included in the price of admission, but you'll need to book 
                    a private tour to go upstairs.<br>
                    
                    Other noteworthy places for sightseeing at City Palace include the Mubarak Mahal (Welcome Palace), 
                    which contains displays of dazzling costumes and textiles; the Armoury, a museum-like space dedicated 
                    to preserving finely crafted daggers and swords; Pritam Niwas Chowk (Peacock Courtyard), which has 
                    mesmerizing doorways painted to look like the feathers of its namesake bird; and Diwan-i-Am 
                    (Hall of Public Audience), which showcases the palace's exquisite collection of miniature paintings.</p>

                <img id="jantar-mantar" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-jantar-mantar.jpg" alt="jantar-mantar">
                <p class="captions">Jantar Mantar, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-than-life abstract 
                    sculptures. But this is not an art gallery—it's a special collection of astronomical tools started by 
                    Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.<br>

                    Each of the 20 or so structures at the UNESCO World Heritage Site serves a distinctive purpose. The 
                    observatory's massive sun dial, known as Samrat Yantra, is particularly striking. At 27 meters tall, 
                    it casts a huge shadow that accurately measures time down to two seconds.<br>
                    
                    The elaborate Jai Prakash also tracks the passing of time, using the shadow of a metal plate suspended
                     above a sunken bowl-like structure. Other tools at the observatory can track stars and even predict 
                     eclipses.</p>

                <img id="hawa-mahal" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-hawa-mahal.jpg" alt="hawa-mahal">
                <p class="captions">Hawa Mahal, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">If you had any preconceived notions about how the buildings in Jaipur look, they probably came from 
                    Hawa Mahal (Palace of Breeze). It has all of the distinctive architectural features that appear in 
                    postcards of the city, from the salmon-pink, honeycombed facade, built to resemble the crown of Hindu 
                    god Krishna, to the geometric accents and rows of tiny windows.<br>

                    The landmark was built in 1799 to allow royal ladies to watch festivals on the street without being 
                    seen by the public. Its 953 windows allow plenty of breeze to pass through, making it an ideal summer 
                    palace.<br>
                    
                    Tourists can learn about the history of the sandstone structure at the palace's small museum—the 
                    ceremonial armor collection is particularly interesting. You can also wander the narrow hallways 
                    that run throughout the palace. Don't miss the colorful glasswork in windows and doorways, which 
                    cast an otherworldly glow on chambers throughout Hawal Mahal.</p>

                <img id="amber-fort" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-amber-fort.jpg" alt="amber-fort">
                <p class="captions">Amber Fort, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">Jaipur is home to one of India's most-visited forts: Amber Fort. Built in the year 1592, the sandstone 
                    and marble monolith stands atop a small hill roughly 20 minute's driving distance northeast of the 
                    center of Jaipur. It's best known for being a pristine example of Rajasthani architecture.<br>

                    Getting to Amber Fort typically involves a short uphill hike that's well worth the effort. It's 
                    decked out with intricate patterns of inlaid marble in nearly every color of the rainbow. The fort is 
                    laid out into four separate sections, each of which has a spectacular garden courtyard outside. While 
                    you'd never know it from above, you can actually explore the fort's underground tunnels, some of which 
                    have been restored.<br>
                    
                    This UNESCO World Heritage Site has a fascinating history of legends, betrayals, and romance—but the
                     best way for tourists to hear these stories is to hire a private guide at the Amber Fort.</p>

                <img id="albert-hall-museum" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-albert-hall-museum.jpg" alt="albert-hall-museum">
                <p class="captions">Albert Hall Museum, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">When English writer Rudyard Kipling visited the Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur, he wrote that it was 
                    a "rebuke to all other museums in India from Calcutta downwards." That's high praise coming from the 
                    son of a curator, and fitting for this renowned institution.<br>

                    The oldest museum in Rajasthan, the Albert Hall Museum boasts an extensive collection of art and 
                    historically significant artifacts. Come for the Egyptian mummy, stay to see antique coins from 
                    different periods in India's history, charming permanent exhibits of miniature paintings, 18th-century 
                    costumes worn by members of different castes, and a peculiar collection of 19th-century clay figures 
                    demonstrating all the yoga poses.<br>
                    
                    Hot tip: Visit the museum at night, when multicolored lights brighten the exterior of the alluring 
                    building.</p>

                <img id="birla-mandir" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-birla-mandir.jpg" alt="birla-mandir">
                <p class="captions">Birla-Mandir, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">In a city that seems to be dipped from top to bottom in pink, the stark white marble Birla Mandir stands
                     out—big time. The Hindu temple pays tribute to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and purity, and Vishnu, 
                     one of the religion's main deities.<br>

                    The marvelous structure exudes a quiet, peaceful vibe, offering just the right atmosphere to 
                    appreciate fine marble carvings, shrines to gods, and gorgeous sunset views. While you don't need 
                    more than 30 minutes to get a sense of the space, the experience will prove to be a restorative break 
                    from a day of sightseeing.</p>

                <img id="nahargarh-fort" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-nahargarh-fort.jpg" alt="nahargarh-fort">
                <p class="captions">Nahargarh Fort, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">When it comes to sightseeing around Jaipur, the views don't get better than what you'll find at 
                    Nahargarh Fort. Also known as Tiger Fort, the nearly 300-year-old fort overlooks the entire city 
                    from atop the Aravalli Hills—a prime location for the structure to defend Jaipur against enemies 
                    many years ago.<br>

                    More than just a formidable barrier though, this fort also contains Madhavendra Bhawan, a summer 
                    destination for royalty. The sumptuous Rajasthani building features a dozen identical boudoirs for 
                    the queens, which all connect to the king's suite through mural-filled corridors.<br>
                    
                    Tourists can also explore the fort's wax museum and sculpture park. And if you're feeling hungry, 
                    swing by one of the fort's many restaurants to tuck into traditional Indian cuisine.</p>

                <img id="galta-ji" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-galta-ji.jpg" alt="galta-ji">
                <p class="captions">Galta Ji, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">Sources of water can be few and far between in the desert state of Rajasthan. 
                    So it's no wonder that when people discovered a natural spring in a mountain pass in the 
                    Aravalli Hills, they honored it by building the Hindu temple Galta Ji. Nestled between cliffs, 
                    the temple features a few sacred water tanks, some with modest fountains, as well as frescoes that 
                    tell tales about Hindu god Krishna.<br>

                    While the official name for this place is Galta Ji, it's better known as the Monkey Temple 
                    for the hundreds of macaques and langurs that live here. Daring tourists might opt to buy a 
                    handful of peanuts at the gate to tempt the monkeys, but you're better off just watching the 
                    rambunctious creatures from a distance.</p>

                <img id="jal-mahal" class="place-img" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/09/india-jaipur-top-attractions-jal-mahal.jpg" alt="jal-mahal">
                <p class="captions">Jal Mahal, Jaipur,Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="para">One look at the Jal Mahal, and you might think you're seeing a mirage. The graceful palace seems 
                    to float atop the twinkling Man Sagar Lake—a calm sight compared to the rest of the frenzied city.<br>

                    While it appears to have just one story, the Water Palace has four other levels submerged beneath
                     a reservoir. Tourists can't access the site, however, that may change in the future. Rumor has it 
                    that entrepreneurs want to convert the decaying space into a luxe restaurant.<br>
                    
                    For now, simply appreciate the beauty of the palace from afar. At night, it's lit up in all its 
                    glory, casting a golden, glowing reflection on the water.</p>
